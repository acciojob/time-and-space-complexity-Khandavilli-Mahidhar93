	<h1>Shortnote on Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is measure of how long an algorithm takes to run without looking to size of input. The algorithms with low time complexity has most efficiency. </p>
	<p>Space Complexity of a function is determined by the amount of memory it uses. So, when algorithm performs computation on each item it takes O(n) time.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity example. If we want to intialize an array of n integer, then its space complexity would be.</b></p>
